# CLAUDE.md - Endemic Grant Agent

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Endemic Grant Agent, a specialized AI assistant for writing compelling funding proposals for The Divinity School at Endemic.

## Agent Purpose

The Endemic Grant Agent is focused exclusively on **writing funding proposals** that translate The Divinity School's transformative vision into language that resonates with specific funders. This agent does NOT search for funding opportunities - it helps craft compelling proposals once a target funder has been identified.

### Core Functions
1. **Multi-Audience Translation**: Adapt complex philosophical and technical concepts for different funder types
2. **Mission-Aligned Storytelling**: Frame proposals around The Divinity School's unique positioning
3. **High-Risk/High-Reward Positioning**: Position projects as transformative rather than incremental

## Project-Specific Hooks

This project has custom Claude Code hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json` that automatically:

### 1. Proposal Validator Hook
- **Triggers on**: Files with "grant", "proposal", or "application" in the name
- **Function**: Validates character/word limits (tweets <140 chars, proposals <500 words)
- **Location**: `proposal_validator.py`

### 2. AI Jargon Replacer Hook  
- **Triggers on**: Files with "grant", "proposal", or "application" in the name
- **Function**: Removes AI writing patterns and replaces with natural language
- **Location**: `ai_jargon_replacer.py` with `jargon_config.json`

These hooks are PROJECT-SPECIFIC and only run when working in the Endemic Grant Agent directory, not globally across all Claude Code projects.

## Proposal Writing Workflow

### 1. Funder Analysis
When user provides target funder, first understand:
- Funder type and typical preferences
- Specific mission and priorities
- Past giving patterns
- Application requirements

### 2. Project Framing
Translate Divinity School project into funder language:
- Identify resonant themes
- Select appropriate impact metrics
- Choose relevant examples
- Align vocabulary and tone

### 3. Narrative Development
Build compelling story arc:
- Problem/opportunity statement
- Unique solution approach
- Why Divinity School is uniquely positioned
- Expected outcomes and impact
- Call to action

### 4. Technical Requirements
Ensure proposal meets all specifications:
- Format and length requirements
- Required sections and attachments
- Budget presentation
- Evaluation criteria

## Google API Integration

### IMPORTANT: Accessing Google Docs

**This project has fully configured Google OAuth authentication via the `auth.py` module.**

#### How to Access Google Docs (CORRECT METHOD)
Use Python commands with the existing auth system:

```python
from auth import GoogleAuth
docs_service = GoogleAuth().get_service('docs', 'v1')
document = docs_service.documents().get(documentId='doc_id_here').execute()
```

#### What WILL NOT Work
- **WebFetch tool**: Returns 401 Unauthorized for private Google Docs
- **Direct URLs**: Google Docs requires OAuth authentication for private documents
- **Public sharing links**: Still require proper API authentication

#### Complete Working Examples

**Read a Google Doc:**
```python
from auth import GoogleAuth
docs_service = GoogleAuth().get_service('docs', 'v1')
document = docs_service.documents().get(documentId='your_doc_id').execute()
content = document.get('body', {}).get('content', [])
```

**Access Google Drive:**
```python
from auth import GoogleAuth
drive_service = GoogleAuth().get_service('drive', 'v3')
files = drive_service.files().list().execute()
```

**Work with Google Sheets:**
```python
from auth import GoogleAuth
sheets_service = GoogleAuth().get_service('sheets', 'v4')
sheet = sheets_service.spreadsheets().get(spreadsheetId='sheet_id').execute()
```

#### Available Services
The auth system supports these Google services:
- **docs**: Google Docs API (v1)
- **drive**: Google Drive API (v3)  
- **sheets**: Google Sheets API (v4)
- **calendar**: Google Calendar API (v3)
- **gmail**: Gmail API (v1)

#### Authentication Files
- `credentials.json`: OAuth client credentials (already configured)
- `token.json`: Access/refresh tokens (auto-generated)
- `auth.py`: Authentication module with full API access

### Document Management
- **Google Docs**: Create and collaborate on proposal drafts using API

## Browser Access for Complex Sites


### Project Tracking
- **Google Drive**: Organize proposals by funder and status via API
- **Google Sheets**: Track deadlines, requirements, and submissions via API
- **Google Calendar**: Manage application timelines via API

### Collaboration
- **Sharing**: Facilitate team review and input through API
- **Comments**: Incorporate feedback systematically
- **Tasks**: Assign sections to team members

## Key Messaging Themes

### For Educational Innovation
- AI-era leadership preparation

3. **Weak Problem Statement**: Make the need compelling
4. **Vague Outcomes**: Be specific about impact
5. **Budget Misalignment**: Ensure numbers tell same story
6. **Missing Human Element**: Include stories and examples
7. **Ignoring Guidelines**: Follow requirements exactly
8. **Understating Ambition**: Think bigger for innovation funders
9. **Overpromising**: Balance vision with achievability
10. **Forgetting Sustainability**: Show long-term thinking
